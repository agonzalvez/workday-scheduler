# Workday Scheduler
## Description:
- Created a simple workday scheduler, which tells the user the current day and date, divides the day by the hour, identifies past, current and future hours by color-coding the background of the specific container, and lastly, it allows the user to save any events/acitivities into their browser's local storage.
## Process:
 1. Created a HTML, CSS and JS files
 2. Linked all files accordingly
 3. Created divs for all rows and columns
 4. Formatted all applicable classes to "row" so I could later format to a GRID layout
 5. Added momentjs on javascript file to display the current day and date on the header
 6.
